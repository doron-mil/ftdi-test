# FT245RL:

**This project is adding and using addON for controling FT245RL
device.**

**It relies on the ftdi package:  [ftdi](https://github.com/thomaschaaf/node-ftdi)**

# Installation
    
    npm npm clean_install

# Running ( after connecting the device)

    npm start

### Modification:

* The index.js is to use the addOn
* The FT245RL/index.js is the interface to communicate with the C++.

You can change those two (Or more...) according to your needs.
